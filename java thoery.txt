A class is a group of objects which have  common properties. It is a logical entity.

Java will not allow you to write code randomly, it says whatever the logic, methods variables you want to write,
   it has to be written in one entity (written somewhere).  It should be wrapped with one entity and this entity is
   called 'class'. You can any classname.

public static void main
When the main method is declared public, it means that it can be used outside of this class as well.
The word static means that we want to access a method without making its objects. As we call the main method without creating any objects.
The word void indicates that it does not return any value. The main is declared as void because it does not return any value.
Main is the method, which is an essential part of any Java program.

String[] args
It is an array where each element is a string, which is named as args. If you run the Java code through a console, you can pass the input parameter. The main() takes it as an input.

System.out.println();
The statement is used to print the output on the screen where the system is a predefined class, out is an object of the Print Writer class. The method println prints the text on the screen with a new line. All Java statements end with a semicolon.



Braces
The curly brackets are used to group all the commands together. To make sure that the commands belong to a class or a method.
